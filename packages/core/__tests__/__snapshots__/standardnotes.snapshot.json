      "data": "<h2>Moving beyond localStorage</h2><h3>IndexedDB &#x26;\n WebCrypto</h3><p>It's hard to believe that as of 2016, the\n best method for offline storage in a web app was\n localStorage, a simple key-value store with a 5mb data\n limit. These kinds of stores are typically meant to store\n user preferences and basic user information. So if you\n wanted to build an application that offered end-to-end\n encryption AND search capability, you couldn't. For this\n reason, we have had to make compromises in our privacy, at\n a cost that is everyday becoming more expensive.</p><p>But\n while we were selling our privacy cheaply and letting\n companies run amuck with our data, a brave few engineers\n have been building the future of the web, and we have yet\n to take full notice.</p><p>Search and encryption are one\n another's arch enemies. Simply put, you can't offer\n convenient search on top of encrypted data. And since most\n of the heavy lifting and data processing in web apps today\n are performed server side, servers <em>require</em> read\n access to all data. But if the server could read your data,\n then practically any engineer of the company could read\n your data, and if an engineer could read your data, then so\n could you know who.</p><p>Companies have been clutching on\n to this excuse with great leisure, and we have capitulated\n to their seemingly well reasoned response. However, in this\n great again year of 2017 which we find ourselves in today,\n that answer no longer holds up.</p><p>WebCrypto and\n IndexedDB are the one-two punch to a new era of encrypted,\n offline, and privacy centric web applications.</p><p>Before\n WebCrypto, practical applications wanting to perform crypto\n and encryption methods in the browser relied on libraries\n like CrpytoJS, a painfully slow library without access to\n proper system resources and lacking, amongst other things,\n a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n WebCrypto on the other hand is, to the most accurate\n description I could think of, a beast. Whereas the\n performance of a key derivation function like PBKDF2 in\n CryptoJS clocked in at around 5,000 hashes in 6 seconds, my\n simple WebCrypto tests had no problem running 1.5 million\n hashes in less than a second. This is the crypto library\n that the world of web apps have been so desperately\n awaiting.</p><p>On the other end is IndexedDB: a full,\n structured, and queriable database with a data capacity\n limit of 50% of the user's disk space, available right in\n the browser. As of 2016, all major browsers support it,\n including mobile browsers. This means applications like\n those that center around private user data can now easily\n encrypt data locally, send encrypted data to the server,\n and store decrypted data locally in the privacy of the user's\n own database.</p><p>The excuse not to take advantage of\n these long awaited set of privacy-fulfilling tools that\n users are desperately craving is no longer technical, but\n philosophical and economical. Some companies cherish user\n data far too much to ever forego not being able to read it\n themselves. You know which companies I'm referring to. They\n will continue ignoring user demand for privacy at their own\n peril.</p><p>Web developers: the tools for disruption are\n now at your feet.</p><hr /><p><em>We've implemented both\n  WebCrypto and IndexedDB into our own web-based notes app,\n  Standard Notes, for end-to-end encryption and full offline\n  search with surprisingly great ease and little resistance.</em></p><p><em>More\n  info on <a\n   href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API\">WebCrypto</a>\n  and <a\n   href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\">IndexedDB</a>.\n  The docs for IndexedDB state that it\n  \"is powerful, but may seem too complicated for simple cases\",\n  but this absolutely wasn't the case for us. The API is\n  delightfully high level.</em></p>",

See, now they vanish,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">The\n faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved\n them,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">To become renewed,\n transfigured, in another pattern.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Sin is Behovely, but</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">All shall be well, and</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">All manner of thing shall be well.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">If I think, again, of this place,</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And of people, not wholly\n commendable,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Of not immediate\n kin or kindness,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">But of some\n peculiar genius,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">All touched by\n a common genius,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">United in the\n strife which divided them;</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">If I\n think of a king at nightfall,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Of\n three men, and more, on the scaffold</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And a few who died forgotten</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">In other places, here and abroad,</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And of one who died blind and quiet,</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Why should we celebrate</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">These dead men more than the dying?</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">It is not to ring the bell backward</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Nor is it an incantation</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">To summon the spectre of a Rose.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">We cannot revive old factions</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">We cannot restore old policies</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Or follow an antique drum.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">These men, and those who opposed them</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And those whom they opposed</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Accept the constitution of silence</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And are folded in a single party.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Whatever we inherit from the\n fortunate</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">We have taken from\n the defeated</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">What they had to\n leave us - a symbol:</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">A symbol\n perfected in death.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">And all\n shall be well and</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">All manner of\n thing shall be well</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">By the\n purification of the motive</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">In\n the ground of our beseeching.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">IV</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">The dove descending breaks the air</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">With flame of incandescent terror</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Of which the tongues declare</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">The one dischage from sin and error.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">The only hope, or else despair</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies in the\n choice of pyre of pyre-</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To\n be redeemed from fire by fire.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Who then devised the torment? Love.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Love is the unfamiliar Name</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Behind the hands that wove</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">The intolerable shirt of flame</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Which human power cannot remove.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only live,\n only suspire</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumed\n by either fire or fire.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">V</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">What we call the beginning is often\n the end</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">And to make and end is\n to make a beginning.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">The end is\n where we start from. And every phrase</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And sentence that is right (where\n every word is at home,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Taking\n its place to support the others,</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">The word neither diffident nor\n ostentatious,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">An easy commerce\n of the old and the new,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">The\n common word exact without vulgarity,</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">The formal word precise but not\n pedantic,</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">The complete consort\n dancing together)</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Every phrase\n and every sentence is an end and a beginning,</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Every poem an epitaph. And any action</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Is a step to the block, to the fire,\n down the sea&apos;s throat</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Or\n to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">We die with the dying:</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">See, they depart, and we go with\n them.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">We are born with the\n dead:</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">See, they return, and\n bring us with them.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">The moment\n of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Are of equal duration. A people\n without history</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Is not redeemed\n from time, for history is a pattern</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Of timeless moments. So, while the\n light fails</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">On a winter&apos;s\n afternoon, in a secluded chapel</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">History\n is now and England.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">With the drawing of this Love and the\n voice of this Calling</p><p data-spacing=\"single\"></p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">We shall not cease from exploration</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And the end of all our exploring</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Will be to arrive where we started</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And know the place for the first\n time.</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Through the unknown,\n unremembered gate</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">When the last\n of earth left to discover</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Is\n that which was the beginning;</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">At\n the source of the longest river</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">The\n voice of the hidden waterfall</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">And\n the children in the apple-tree</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Not\n known, because not looked for</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">But\n heard, half-heard, in the stillness</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Between two waves of the sea.</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">Quick now, here, now, always&mdash;</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">A condition of complete simplicity</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">(Costing not less than everything)</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">And all shall be well and</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">All manner of thing shall be well</p><p\n data-spacing=\"single\">When the tongues of flames are\n in-folded</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">Into the crowned knot\n of fire</p><p data-spacing=\"single\">And the fire and the\n rose are one.</p>",
