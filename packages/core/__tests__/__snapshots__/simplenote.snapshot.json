If someone is chopping wood don’t\n just stand there.</p><p>Dialogue</p><ul><li>I could tell\n  you a story. It’s the story told to all boys when they are\n  initiated. Do you want me to it? -</li></ul><p>If you want\n to tell it go ahead. -</p><p>Don’t say that. Say you want\n me to tell the story.</p><p>The Hunter’s Wife</p><p>1 She\n looks out the window the snow is falling her husband went\n hunting for elk the boy went along too a neighbor thinks he\n saw them at Red Hill she hasn’t seen the sun all day.</p><p>2\n She was out in the woods gathering pine nuts and there\n under a tree was a fawn the fawn said -Tie me up. -</p><p>3\n The men left her in camp for the day a wounded buck charged\n right into the fire she hit him over the head with a frying\n pan.</p><p>The Fire in Your Fireplace You started it right\n up with one match, it must be your aunt loves you it was\n quiet for awhile but now listen to that fire! The flames go\n straight up it roars! Someone is hungry, it must be your\n great-grandparents every time you eat take a little bread a\n little meat throw it in the fire, say - Great-grandparents!\n Eat! - That’s the shortest prayer there is.</p><p>Winter\n Solstice Here is the place of fear for four days no greasy\n foods are eaten there is no coffee no trade all places of\n business are closed for ten days no sweepings no garbage is\n taken out of the house no fire is taken out of the house\n not even cigarettes are lighted outside people shouldn’t\n use their cars the street lights are all turned out this is\n the middle of time.</p><p>Recipe Fill a bowl with hot water\n add, to taste: dried leaves of wild mint ground chili\n onions dried chinchweed flowers wolfberries and venison\n jerky. This is called hot-bowl it is an ancient dish.</p><p>Cornshucking\n Pull down the husk all around then twist it all off at once\n with the stem put the dry ears in this pile for us put the\n damp ears the moldy ears in this one for the hogs and throw\n the shucks out there some of the ears are yellow some are\n blue red white some are pretty the multicolored ones some\n are black look for the Fully-Finished-Ear without a single\n kernel missing right to the very tip a deer, a buck wears\n that one on his breast and the Flat-Ear with a forked tip a\n doe wears that one on her breast and the Road-Ear with a\n groove down its whole length runners wear that one on their\n backs now here it is a Fully-Finished-Ear but it’s wet I’ll\n put it at the edge of the good pile and here is an ear\n yellow, but each kernel is tinged with red it’s sort of\n pretty there’s no name for this one I’ll put it here on the\n fence rail maybe I’ll do something with it later.</p><p>#poem</p><p>Tags:\n poem, Reference</p>"

Back to work!\"</li><li>Practice\n  single-handling with every task -- once you begin, refuse\n  to do anything else until your #1 task is completed.</li><li>When\n  you finish with a task, put everything away.</li><li>One\n  minute in planning saves ten minutes in execution -- a\n  1000% return on your investment.</li><li>Identify your\n  limiting step: the task or function that determines the\n  speed at which you achieve your goal.</li><li>Define your\n  goal and then ask,\n  \"Why am I not there already? What is holding me back?\"</li><li>With\n  major tasks, you need blocks of uninterrupted time; turn\n  off the telephone!</li><li>Plan every day the evening\n  before; then begin first thing the next morning on your\n  most important task.</li></ol><p>##e. planning:</p><ol><li>Continually\n  write, rewrite and program your goals and activities to\n  keep yourself focused.</li><li>Action without planning is\n  the cause of every failure.</li><li>Neatness is a key\n  personal productivity habit; important tasks are not\n  entrusted to messy people.</li><li>Keep your desk and work\n  area clean and well-organized. Clean it off completely at\n  the end of each day.</li><li>Clear your desk of everything\n  except the one task that you are working on at the moment.</li><li>Handle\n  each piece of paper or information just once; when you\n  pick it up, do something with it.</li><li>30% of your\n  time, on average, can be spent looking for things you've\n  misplaced!</li><li>80% of the materials filed are never\n  needed again; avoid creating filing work for others.</li><li>Use\n  your waste basket generously;\n  \"When in doubt, throw it out.\"</li><li>If it is not\n  necessary to do it, it is necessary not to do it.</li></ol><p>##f.\n procrastination:</p><ol><li>Procrastination is not only the\n  thief of time; but it also is the thief of life and dreams\n  as well.</li><li>The most valuable reputation you can\n  develop is that of a person who gets things done fast.</li><li>When\n  you do things quickly for others, they think you are\n  smarter and more competent.</li><li>As Nietsche wrote,\n  \"A man can bear any what,  if he has a big enough why.\"\n  Overcome procrastination with intensely desired goal</li><li>Visualize,\n  imagine and feel the task is already completed before you\n  begin.</li><li>Set deadlines for yourself on all important\n  tasks and then discipline yourself to meet them.</li><li>Speak\n  to yourself positively all the time:\n  \"Do it now!  Do it now! Do it now!\"</li><li>Refuse to\n  allow yourself to make excuses or rationalizations for\n  procrastination; hold your own feet to the fire.</li><li>Give\n  yourself a reward for each step you take toward completion\n  and goal attainment.</li><li>\"A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a single step.\"\n  Do one thing to get started - now!</li></ol><p>##g. waste:</p><ol><li>Telephone\n  Interruptions Have your calls held or screened. Return\n  them all at the same time.</li><li>Drop-in Visitors Stand\n  up immediately, walk out of your office with them, keep\n  moving.</li><li>Meetings Always have an agenda, start and\n  stop on time; remove all the chairs.</li><li>Unexpected\n  Emergencies Operate in real time; do it now; move quickly\n  to resolve the situation.</li><li>Procrastination Break up\n  the tasks into small chunks; start with the most important\n  -- and keep at it!</li><li>Indecision Most decisions\n  (80%!) should be made when they come up. Make a habit of\n  being decisive.</li><li>Mistakes Take the time to do the\n  job right the first time; be patient and persistent.</li><li>Knowledge\n  Dedicate yourself to personal and professional\n  development; get better at your key tasks.</li><li>Focus\n  Always know exactly what it is you are trying to\n  accomplish, and concentrate all your energies in that\n  direction.</li><li>Socializing Make your conversations\n  short, focused, and to the point. Discuss personal matters\n  away from work.</li></ol><p>##h. multitask:</p><ol><li>Your\n  ability to plan, organize and accomplish complex tasks is\n  essential to your success.</li><li>Project management and\n  time management go hand in hand with high productivity.</li><li>Your\n  ability to bring together a team of people to complete a\n  multi-task job is the mark of executive excellence.</li><li>You\n  begin each project by defining the ideal desired result\n  and working back to the beginning.</li><li>People are not\n  just the only thing; they are everything. Assemble the\n  team first.</li><li>Instill ownership of the project in\n  each team member by involving him or her fully in the\n  planning process.</li><li>Before beginning, list every\n  task, function and activity that must be completed. Assign\n  responsibility and set deadlines for each.</li><li>Inspect\n  what you expect -- if it's important, stay on top of it at\n  all times.</li></ol><p>Tags: Ed, NextProject, Reference</p>"
