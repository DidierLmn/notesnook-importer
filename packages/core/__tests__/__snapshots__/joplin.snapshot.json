To add a plugin, go to the &quot;Plugins&quot;\n section in the config screen. From there you can search and\n install plugins, as well as search or update plugins.</p>\n<h2>Attachments</h2>\n<p>Any kind of file can be attached to a note. In Markdown,\n links to these files are represented as an ID. In the note\n viewer, these files, if they are images, will be displayed\n or, if they are other files (PDF, text files, etc.) they\n will be displayed as links. Clicking on this link will open\n the file in the default application.</p>\n<p>Images can be attached either by clicking on &quot;Attach\n file&quot; or by pasting (with <code>Ctrl+V</code> or <code>Cmd+V</code>)\n an image directly in the editor, or by drag and dropping an\n image.</p>\n<p>More info about attachments: <a\n  href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#attachments\">https://joplinapp.org/help/#attachments</a></p>\n<h2>Search</h2>\n<p>Joplin supports advanced search queries, which are fully\n documented on the official website: <a\n  href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#searching\">https://joplinapp.org/help/#searching</a></p>\n<h2>Alarms</h2>\n<p>An alarm can be associated with any to-do. It will be\n triggered at the given time by displaying a notification.\n To use this feature, see the documentation: <a\n  href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#notifications\">https://joplinapp.org/help/#notifications</a></p>\n<h2>Markdown advanced tips</h2>\n<p>Joplin uses and renders <a\n  href=\"https://joplinapp.org/markdown/\">Github-flavoured\n  Markdown</a> with a few variations and additions.</p>\n<p>For example, tables are supported:</p>\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th>Tables</th>\n   <th align=\"center\">Are</th>\n   <th align=\"right\">Cool</th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>col 3 is</td>\n   <td align=\"center\">right-aligned</td>\n   <td align=\"right\">&#x24;1600</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>col 2 is</td>\n   <td align=\"center\">centered</td>\n   <td align=\"right\">&#x24;12</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>zebra stripes</td>\n   <td align=\"center\">are neat</td>\n   <td align=\"right\">&#x24;1</td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can also create lists of checkboxes. These checkboxes\n can be ticked directly in the viewer, or by adding an\n &quot;x&quot; inside:</p>\n<ul class=\"checklist\">\n <li class=\"checklist--item\">Milk</li>\n <li class=\"checklist--item\">Eggs</li>\n <li class=\"checklist--item checked\">Beer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Math expressions can be added using the <a\n  href=\"https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/\">KaTeX notation</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"math math-display\">f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n \\hat f(\\xi)\\,e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} \\,d\\xi</div>\n<p>Various other tricks are possible, such as using HTML, or\n customising the CSS.

The notes are\n searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from\n the application directly or from your own text editor. The\n notes are in <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#markdown\">Markdown\n  format</a>. Joplin is available as a <strong>desktop</strong>,\n <strong>mobile</strong> and <strong>terminal</strong>\n application.</p>\n<p>The notes in this notebook give an overview of what\n Joplin can do and how to use it. In general, the three\n applications share roughly the same functionalities; any\n differences will be clearly indicated.</p>\n<p><img class=\"attachment\" data-filename=\"AllClients.png\"\n  data-size=\"448800\" data-hash=\"8fe14c70981cfd4c\"\n  data-mime=\"image/png\" alt=\"AllClients.png\"></p>\n<h2>Joplin is divided into three parts</h2>\n<p>Joplin has three main columns:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p><strong>Sidebar</strong> contains the list of your\n   notebooks and tags, as well as the synchronisation\n   status.</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p><strong>Note List</strong> contains the current list of\n   notes - either the notes in the currently selected\n   notebook, the notes in the currently selected tag, or\n   search results.</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p><strong>Note Editor</strong> is the place where you\n   write your notes. There is a <strong>Rich Text editor</strong>\n   and a <strong>Markdown editor</strong> - click on the\n   <strong>Toggle editor</strong> button in the top right\n   hand corner to switch between both! You may also use an\n   <a\n    href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#external-text-editor\">external\n    editor</a> to edit notes. For example you can use Typora\n   as an external editor and it will display the note as\n   well as any embedded images.</p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Writing notes in Markdown</h2>\n<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text\n formatting syntax.

The supported cloud services are the\n following:</p>\n<ul class=\"checklist\">\n <li class=\"checklist--item checked\">ehhehe</li>\n <li class=\"checklist--item\">hehe</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up Joplin Cloud synchronisation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/plans/\">Joplin Cloud</a>\n is a web service specifically designed for Joplin. Besides\n synchronising your data, it also allows you to publish a\n note to the internet, or share a notebook with your\n friends, family or colleagues. Joplin Cloud, compared to\n other services, also features a number of performance\n improvements allowing for faster synchronisation.</p>\n<p>To use it, go to the config screen, then to the\n Synchronisation section. In the list of sync target, select\n &quot;Joplin Cloud&quot;. Enter your email and password,\n and you&apos;re ready to use Joplin Cloud.</p>\n<h2>Setting up Dropbox synchronisation</h2>\n<p>Select &quot;Dropbox&quot; as the synchronisation target\n in the config screen. Then, to initiate the synchronisation\n process, click on the &quot;Synchronise&quot; button in the\n sidebar and follow the instructions.</p>\n<h2>Setting up Nextcloud synchronisation</h2>\n<p>Nextcloud is a self-hosted, private cloud solution. To\n set it up, go to the config screen and select Nextcloud as\n the synchronisation target. Then input the WebDAV URL (to\n get it, go to your Nextcloud page, click on Settings in the\n bottom left corner of the page and copy the URL). Note that\n it has to be the <strong>full URL</strong>, so for example\n if you want the notes to be under <code>/Joplin</code>, the\n URL would be something like <code>https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/Joplin</code>\n (note that &quot;/Joplin&quot; part). And <strong>make sure\n  to create the &quot;/Joplin&quot; directory in Nextcloud</strong>.\n Finally set the username and password. If it does not work,\n please <a\n  href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/61#issuecomment-373282608\">see\n  this explanation</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Setting up OneDrive or WebDAV synchronisation</h2>\n<p>OneDrive and WebDAV are also supported as synchronisation\n services. Please see <a\n  href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#synchronisation\">the\n  synchronisation documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Using End-To-End Encryption</h2>\n<p>Joplin supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on all the\n applications. E2EE is a system where only the owner of the\n data can read it. It prevents potential eavesdroppers -\n including telecom providers, internet providers, and even\n the developers of Joplin from being able to access the\n data. Please see the <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/e2ee/\">End-To-End\n  Encryption Tutorial</a> for more information about this\n feature and how to enable it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"attachment\" data-filename=\"print.pdf\"\n  data-size=\"17864\" data-hash=\"61a1e8ce92705420\"\n  data-mime=\"application/pdf\" contenteditable=\"false\"\n  title=\"print.pdf\">\n  <em>&#xa0;</em>\n  <span class=\"filename\">print.pdf</span>\n </span></p>",
